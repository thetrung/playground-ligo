# playground-ligo
A collection of Tezos Ligo smart contract to play around.

### 1. Why playground ?
Because learning a new language ( Ocaml ) and a smart contract rule at the same time could be messy pretty much, especially on Tezos with Ligo, by 4 different styles that I can find on tutorials. But once I get used to it, I figured out that it has a flow of ML family like what I experienced on F# and OCaml, but much worse editor support.

So it could be better if I can, again, saving up a collection of samples during my learning, just like Rust, Lua and JS before. The quality of this collection could be better with time.

### 2. Important
TODO: update what I noticed here during the learning that is easy to make newbie fall into mistakes of writing smart contract.

I pick CameLigo as my writing style as it seem to be cleanest one but a lot of mistakes waiting here.
